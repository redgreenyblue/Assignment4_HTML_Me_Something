					<p>Erin and I live in a small house in South St. Louis City. Our household consists of ourselves and a blended family of lovable cats. They are our lovable little monsters who like to play, cuddle with their humans, eat, and sleep. </p>

					<ul>
						<img src = 'cat_pics/murphy_bed'>
						<li>Murphy is the cat that I brought to the household. I took him in five years ago when my neighbor asked if I could take in this stray cat. He is a six year old tabby who loves to lay on my lap, and moaning at wee hours of the night at our backdoor - he is not allowed to go outside like all our cats.</li>
						<br></br>
						<img src = 'cat_pics/gus_hunter'>
						<li>Gus is our youngest cat at two years old. He was found as kitten who took a ride in a truck from a farm to Erin's sister and brother-in-law's home. He is mischievous, sweet, social, and will eat your food if you are not careful.</li>
						<br></br>
						<img src = 'cat_pics/gus_rollie_cuddle'>				
						<li>Rollie is the elder cat in the house at fifteen years old. Originally from Florida, he is our sweetest furball. As you can see he and Gus are best buds.</li>

					<p>We love all our boys, but unfortunately we must keep Murphy and Rollie separate as Murphy will chase and fight him. Gus gets along with both. Its a good thing too, because he is the strongest and most athletic of our cats. Our cats love playing with toy mice, laser pointers, and play fighting in the case of Gus with Rollie and to a lesser extent with Murphy. These kittie boys rule our home, and we wouldn't have any other way.</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>I'll leave you with one last picture of Gus being the brat he is.</p>
